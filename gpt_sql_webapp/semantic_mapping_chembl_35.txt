# === Semantic Mapping for ChEMBL Natural Language Interface ===
# This file defines domain-specific mappings to translate natural language terms into SQL-compatible expressions.
# It is designed for use with ChEMBL SQLite datasets (e.g., chembl_35.db).
# Language model agents should apply these mappings to build accurate queries from user questions.
